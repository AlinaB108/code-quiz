// Pseudo code - Code quiz 10 questions and 60seconds to answer
//Create global variables for timer, score, questions and initials
// Start the quiz
  //Add a button to start the quiz, answers should be clickable too
  //Make a function with a timer and (?)questions and score inside that function
//Display a question and 4 possible answers
  //Get a question from the list (probably an array, where a question will be randomly selected from an array)
//Check if the selected answer is correct (not correct - remove 10sec, if correct - add score)
  //Display a message about the answered message - Correct!/Wrong!
  //Display the changes for time on the screen
//Quiz ends when there is no time left
//When the game is over need to display the final score and input field for initials
//Save initials and score (make a list for future score where we can add text with via JS?)
  //Add a button to save the progress
